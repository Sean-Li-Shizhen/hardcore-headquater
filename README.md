# hardcore-headquater

## What is this project about?

This project aims to give a prototype of typical strategic/tactical wargames where message transaction became way more important.

On a typical tactic game that is popular now, it will give the player control to all the units it have. Every single command the user gives is immediately reflected on the unit. That is hardly how real world works. Usually when a command is sent from the headquarter, it takes sometime to reach the actual unit. This unrealisticity makes battle seems so easy to control. This project aims to make time required for information to reach end units a consideration. It could also feature situations of contact means are cut by enemy.
